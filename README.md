# SVG-Generator

## Description
My motivation to create this app was to try and build a logo generator for a user to create an SVG file for their logo.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the app in your terminal

## Usage
This app can be used to generate a simple SVG file for a logo.  The user can input up to three letters, choose from one of three shapes, and what colors they want their logo to be.
